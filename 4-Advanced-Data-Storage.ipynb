    "\n",
    "* **Large language models (LLMs)** are a class of artificial intelligence models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. These models are based on deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, and have many parameters, often numbering in the hundreds of millions or even billions. Some well-known examples include OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, and Google's BERT and T5 models.\n",

    "* \" [**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications. The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications. \" - [Source](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/LangChain#:~:text=LangChain%20is%20an%20open%20source,to%20develop%20LLM%2Dpowered%20applications.)\n",
